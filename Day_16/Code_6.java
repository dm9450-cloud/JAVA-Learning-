// Variable Practice Question 4
// Declare two variables as a and b. Initialize the values to those variables as 1042 and 7 respectively.

// Declare another two variables quo and rem that will store the quotient and remainder of these numbers taking a as dividend and b as divisor.

// Print quo and rem in a line separated by a space.

// Input Format
// No input. User has to declare the variables themselves.

// Output Format
// Print the quotient and remainder of these numbers by taking a as dividend and b as divisor.

// Output:

// 148 6 

// Topics
// Basics
